# Purpose and Usage

The purpose of this project is primarily just to mess around with REST APIs. However, the aim is to get a fully functional desktop client which can view all aspects of YNAB. There are several components:

## APIs

### Budget API

This part of the API is concerned with budgets. It will get a list of budgets, or when one is specified, will get all details of a budget.

### Account API

This part of the API is concerned with accounts within a budget. It will get all accounts within a budget, and be able to list a specific account.

### Category API

This part of the API is concerned with categories within a budget. It can list all categories, and get details of each specific one.

### Payee API

This part of the API deals with payees per budget.

### Transaction API

This part of the API deals with transactions per account within a budget. It can list all transactions, segregate them per category, or per account.
